Roadmap:

FOR FINAL:
"Look" command - tells you surrounding area
Ability to drop items AND leave them there to pick back up Later
At least 15 "rooms" - crypt dungeon?
Binary save system?
Use function - able to use it on environment, not only tomes

add try/catch blocks for inputs to not crash code
Make first biome - forest
    -points of interest like goblin camps, caves, crypts that you can find
    -when found, will you let travel back to them when leaving town
Different types of spells - freeze enemy, raise/lower attack, etc.
    -buyable books that teach you spells
Posion and Antipoison
    - posion deals damge at the beginning of every round, antiposion makes you immune for a combat
potion making/alchemy?
Set number of quests available per town?
Quest descriptions
Make it so some weapons can't use shields
Flavor text when dying/killing enemies
Make squares have weights - add a min roll and max roll ints
    - When it rolls to generate the square, roll 1-100
    - if it falls between the square's min and max, it is that square.
Add more descriptions
    - 2D array of string descriptions, to randomly choose for each area
Monster Encyclopedia
